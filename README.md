# Trading Post

Still in very early development. Not really a game yet.

Try it out for yourself at: https://mark-chimes.github.io/trading-post/
(If the background doesn't load, try refreshing).

## UI and Accessibility: 
 * Blind-accessible (with screen-reader)
 * Supported on reasonable browsers
 * Runs on mobile
 * Dark-mode UI with grid layout
 * Background looks like wood
 * "Last Event" box so you know what just happened
 * "Story thus far" box so you know everything that's happened
 
## Customers
 * Up to 26 different customers
 * Pick the customer to whom you want to speak
 * Sorted by affluence for your convenience
 * Kick out customers you don't like
 * Customers are described on entry
 * Different types of customers have preferences for different types of item
 * There are female customers, but if the player is male then this game fails the Bechdel test.

## Sales
 * Sell swords, axes, trail mix, and more!
 * Limited stock per day - so sell carefully
 * Automatic sales price based on what customer is willing to pay
 * Hint boxes tell you how to get a customer to pay more
 * Schmooze a customer to sell for more

## Store and Time
 * "Wait" button lets you sit and do nothing for awhile
 * Work from 8am to 5pm 
 * Clean the store for fun
 * Pay rent each day
 * End-of-day summary so you know how well you did
